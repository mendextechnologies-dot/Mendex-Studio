# Three-day implementation checklist

Scope: final foundation addendum of supplied guide; user owns approval decisions. Start: 10 November 2026, Asia/Calcutta. This is an execution sequence, not a claim that elapsed calendar days have passed.

## Day 1 — foundation

- [x] Read complete source guide, inspect workspace and development runtime.
- [x] Establish package boundaries, service contract and engineering rules.
- [x] Implement typed specifications, SQLite v1 migration, products and revisions.
- [x] Create per-revision local workspaces; freeze previous specifications.
- [x] Build real-service desktop dashboard, product editor and navigation.
- [x] Pass persistence, failure-path and desktop smoke tests (10 passed).
- [x] Record environment and test results; initialize local Git baseline.

## Day 2 — extensibility

- [x] Adapter protocol, discovery capability registry and native executable detection/configuration.
- [x] Simulation-run contracts, no automatic execution claims.
- [x] Append-only manual validation entries with provenance and evidence hashes.
- [x] Basic draft HTML/JSON report service and module-specific workspace views.
- [x] Tool Manager, validation/report views and revisioned knowledge content (0.2).
- [x] Verify missing tools, no-PASS-without-evidence, stale evidence and deliberate failure cases (17 tests).

## Day 3 — integration

- [x] VS Code/project-file launching with path validation (automated launch mocks).
- [x] CLI doctor, diagnostic export and UI/core integration.
- [x] Product → specification → revision → tool check → evidence → draft report automated smoke test, including deliberate FAIL (21 tests).
- [x] Reproduce wheel installation in a fresh local environment; document rollback and remaining issues.
- [x] Capture seven desktop screens and run installed-package desktop smoke test.
- [ ] Complete interactive VS Code/native-file handoff and second-engineer clean-machine qualification using docs/manual-acceptance.md.
- [ ] Tag v0.1.0 only after release gates pass; manual packaging optional.

Source repository: https://github.com/mendextechnologies-dot/Mendex-Studio · branch `main`. The integrated build remains `0.1.0.dev3`; native simulation qualification and manufacturing release are not claimed.
